# Team-Profile-Generator
I used object oriented programming to build this Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so I also wrote a unit test for every part of my code and ensured that it passes each test.
