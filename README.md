# Team-Profile-Generator
I used object oriented programming to build this Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so I also wrote a unit test for every part of my code and ensured that it passes each test.

The application uses [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

# Tests:

```bash
npm run test
```
